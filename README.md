Spotify Application

A spotify clone that allows a user to search for their favorite artists and songs. 

Project Goals

This project allowed me to get practice using an API that needed Authentication. I had to go through the CLient Credentials Flow to get access to this Spotify API. I was then given an access token so that I could go ahead and make GET requests. 

How the app works 

There is a search bar for the user to search any track they would like. Each track has the track name, the album that track was apart of, and the duration of the song. When the track is clicked on, the app will redirect the user to the actual spotify website to listen to the song in a new tab.
